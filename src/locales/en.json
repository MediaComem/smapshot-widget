      "stereo_text": "Mono-photogrammetry is opposed to stereo-photogrammetry. In stereo-photogrammetry, a collection of overlapping images is used to compute a 3D model which can be textured by the images. Stereo-photogrammetry is state of the art for generation and extraction of geographic data from images. In Smapshot few images can be used with a stereo-photogrammetry software: only images shot the same day with a large overlap could be used in this way.",
      "stereo_link": "See the list of photogrammetry software",
      "mono_title": "Mono-photogrammetry",
      "mono_textOne": "However, currently, most of the archive images canât be processed with stereo-photogrammetry software. Indeed, typically, the images were shot randomly without a need of a homogeneous coverage of the territory (as in regular photogrammetry projects). By mixing several collections, in famous areas, we can get a better coverage and overlap, but then, the variations due to the time, seasons and illumination challenge the image matching algorithms.",
      "mono_textTwo": "Hence, anyone who wants to extract geographic information of archive images has to use mono-photogrammetry. With a single image it is impossible to recover the depth of the scene. However, once that image location and orientation is accurately computed, the image can be aligned with a 3D model, exactly in the same way as in Smapshotâs 3D viewer. As a result, the 3D world coordinate of a pixel can be recovered. Systems which provide the direct relation of an image and a 3D model are called monoplotters. Currently monoplotters are used to extract information from historical images or to monitor an area with a single camera.",
